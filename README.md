Problem Statement:
Crop production in India is one of the most important sources of income and India is one of the top countries to produce crops. As per this project we will be analyzing some important visualization, creating a dashboard and by going through these we will get most of the insights of Crop production in India.

We have delivered a perfectly analyzed Dashboard of historical agricultural production data from several Indian states so that farmers may forecast their crop yield.
We have created webpage where the dashboard, Report and Story created in IBM Cognos are embedded and user can login to the webpage to access the content.
Also, a predictive model is created to estimate the Crop production using various features using different ML algorithms.


Finally , we sincerely thank IBM team for providing all the facilities to work smoothly.
